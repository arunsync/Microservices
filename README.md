Monolithic architecture
Adv :
  1. Very simple to develop and deploy
  2. It is simple to scale
Dis Adv :
  1. Larger and complex application 
      a. Complex to understand
      b. Development slows down
  2. Slow development. Larger the codebase leads to slower the IDE which makes the developer less productive.
  3. Diffucult to make frequent deployment (change 1 component, we have to deploy other components as well)
  4. Difficult to scale (if we want to scale onle one business functionality, we can't do it)
  5. Tightly coupled components
  6. Inflexible - difficult to adapt to new technologies
